# Quadratic-classifier
The task was to plot the densitiy functions of normal distributions, generate 600 samples and see how the covariance matrices influance the shape of distributions. Next, with assumption that probabilities are the same, for every pair of classes, was to use ML criteria and generate 300 samples, define the decision rule, find procentage of wrongly classified and at the end to repeat for every example with different probabilities.
